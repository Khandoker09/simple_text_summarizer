# simple_text_summarizer

#### This text summarizer was built using the Hugging Face Transformer model deep learning. It is an open-source library. From this library, we have used the T5-small model. The T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model is primarily an abstractive model. Abstractive models generate summaries or paraphrases in a more human-like manner by understanding the input text and generating new, coherent text that captures the essential meaning of the input. They have the ability to produce summaries that may not appear verbatim in the input text and can provide more concise and coherent summaries compared to extractive methods.
#### Tips: Try to avoid the author name, image, or table, only paste the the text you want to summarize
